twitter-feed-resources
======================

Stuff to help authorise and build a custom twitter feed using the https://github.com/stormuk/storm-twitter-for-wordpress WP plugin.

This code builds the Twitter feed. To get the Twitter data in the first place, install the WordPress plugin which is "a Twitter API 1.1 compliant wordpress plugin that provides an array of a users timeline from Twitter for use by theme developers". There is also a standalone PHP class by the same developers on GitHub here: https://github.com/stormuk/storm-twitter. It's really useful!

You will also need to set up a Twitter application here: https://apps.twitter.com/ so that authorisation credentials can be supplied. Credentials are added in the WP backend.
